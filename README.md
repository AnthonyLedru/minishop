# Minishop
This project is the first rush of 42 school's piscine PHP.<br>
We had to make a Minishop without any framework and in php only (without object).

Made with @tbailleu : https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/tbailleu

## Usage

Start a PHP 5 server (the website only work on php 5).
```
php -S localhost:8080
```

Then just run the install.php script to set up the database.
